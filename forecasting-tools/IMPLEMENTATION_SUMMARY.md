# Personality Templates System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive personality templates system for forecasting bots. The system allows for customizing the behavior and characteristics of forecasting bots through configurable personalities and templates.

## Key Components Implemented

1. **Template Manager**: Handles loading and combining templates for different research approaches and forecast types.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/template_manager.py`
   - Manages templates for different research types and question types
   - Applies personality traits to templates

2. **Personality Config**: Manages personality configurations that define how traits are combined.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/personality_config.py`
   - Loads personality configurations from JSON files
   - Provides access to traits and thinking parameters

3. **Personality Manager**: High-level interface for personality-based templates.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/personality_manager.py`
   - Integrates TemplateManager and PersonalityConfig
   - Provides a simplified interface for forecasting bots

4. **Research Templates**: Templates for different research approaches.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/research/`
   - Includes templates for default research, Perplexity research, and smart searcher research

5. **Forecast Templates**: Templates for different question types and bot versions.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/forecasts/`
   - Organized by question type (binary, multiple choice, numeric)
   - Includes templates for different bot versions (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

6. **Personality Traits**: Configurable aspects of personality.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/personality_traits/`
   - Includes reasoning depth, uncertainty approach, expert persona, and thinking style

7. **Personality Configurations**: Predefined combinations of traits.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/personalities/`
   - Includes balanced, cautious, creative, economist, and bayesian personalities

8. **Enhanced Template Bots**: Bot implementations that use the personality templates system.
   - Located at `forecasting_tools/forecast_bots/enhanced_template_bot.py`
   - Includes bot implementations for different quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

9. **Demo Scripts**: Scripts to demonstrate the personality templates system.
   - `personality_demo.py`: Command-line tool for testing personalities
   - `forecasting_tools/personality_templates/usage_example.py`: Example usage of the personality templates API

## Usage

### Basic Usage with Enhanced Template Bots

```python
from forecasting_tools import EnhancedTemplateBotQ2

# Create a bot with a specific personality
bot = EnhancedTemplateBotQ2(personality_name="cautious")

# Run a forecast
report = await bot.forecast_question(question)
```

### Using the Personality Templates API Directly

```python
from forecasting_tools.personality_templates import PersonalityManager

# Create a personality manager
manager = PersonalityManager(
    bot_version="q2",
    personality_name="creative",
    research_type="perplexity_research"
)

# Get a prompt
research_prompt = manager.get_prompt("research_prompt", question="Will AI safety become a major political issue by 2025?")

# Get thinking configuration
thinking_config = manager.get_thinking_config()
```

### Using the Demo Script

```bash
# List available personalities
python personality_demo.py list

# Forecast with a specific personality
python personality_demo.py forecast 12345 cautious

# Compare different personalities
python personality_demo.py compare 12345 --personalities balanced cautious creative
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Personality Traits**: More dimensions of personality could be added.
2. **Custom Template Creation**: A mechanism for users to create their own templates.
3. **Enhanced Visualization**: Tools to visualize differences between personalities.
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track which personalities perform best on different question types.
