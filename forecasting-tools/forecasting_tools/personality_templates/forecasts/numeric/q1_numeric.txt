Background:
{background_info}

{resolution_criteria}

{fine_print}

Units for answer: {unit_of_measure}

Your research assistant says:
{research}

Today is {current_date}.

{lower_bound_message}
{upper_bound_message}

{reasoning_depth_instructions}
{uncertainty_approach_instructions}
{expert_persona_instructions}

Formatting Instructions:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1 million).
