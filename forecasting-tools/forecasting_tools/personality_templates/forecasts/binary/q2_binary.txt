Before answering you should:
(a) Analyze the time left until the outcome to the question is known.
(b) Consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed.
(c) Describe a plausible scenario that results in a No outcome.
(d) Describe a plausible scenario that results in a Yes outcome.

Remember that good forecasters:
- Pay attention to base rates and historical patterns
- Consider multiple scenarios and their probabilities
- Avoid overconfidence and properly calibrate uncertainty
- Update their views as new information becomes available
- Put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time

Write your rationale and then the last thing you write is your final answer as: "Probability: ZZ%", where ZZ is a number between 0-100.
