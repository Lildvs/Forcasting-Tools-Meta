You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.

Your interview question is:
{question_text}

The options are: {options}

Background:
{background_info}

{resolution_criteria}

{fine_print}

Your research assistant says:
{research}

Today is {current_date}.

{reasoning_depth_instructions}
{uncertainty_approach_instructions}
{expert_persona_instructions}
{thinking_style_instructions}

Before answering you should:
(a) Analyze the time left until the outcome to the question is known.
(b) Consider the status quo outcome if nothing changed.
(c) Describe one or more plausible scenarios that could lead to unexpected outcomes.

Remember that good forecasters:
- Pay attention to base rates and historical patterns
- Consider multiple scenarios and their probabilities
- Avoid overconfidence and properly calibrate uncertainty
- Update their views as new information becomes available
- Put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time
- Leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes

Write your rationale and then end with your final probabilities for each option in this order {options} as:
Option_A: Probability_A
Option_B: Probability_B
...
Option_N: Probability_N

The probabilities should sum to 100%.
