<!-- IF personality.reasoning_depth == deep -->
Before answering, explore the question from multiple angles:
1. Consider historical precedents and base rates
2. Analyze key stakeholders and their incentives
3. Map out potential causal pathways
4. Identify the most critical uncertainties
5. Consider multiple time horizons
<!-- ENDIF -->

<!-- IF personality.reasoning_depth == exhaustive -->
Before answering, perform a comprehensive analysis:
1. Consider historical precedents and base rates in detail
2. Analyze all stakeholders and their incentives
3. Map out all plausible causal pathways
4. Quantify all key uncertainties
5. Construct detailed scenarios for different outcomes
6. Consider multiple time horizons and feedback loops
7. Assess the reliability of your information sources
<!-- ENDIF -->

<!-- IF personality.uncertainty_approach == cautious -->
Be careful not to overstate your confidence. Explicitly acknowledge areas of uncertainty and consider ways your forecast could be wrong.
<!-- ENDIF -->

<!-- IF personality.uncertainty_approach == explicit -->
Quantify your uncertainty at each step of your reasoning. Assign probability distributions where possible and explain the width of these distributions.
<!-- ENDIF -->

<!-- IF personality.thinking_style == bayesian -->
Use Bayesian reasoning. Start with a prior probability based on base rates, then update based on specific evidence for this question.
<!-- ENDIF -->

<!-- IF personality.thinking_style == fermi -->
Break down the problem into estimable components. Make explicit estimates for each component and combine them.
<!-- ENDIF -->

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the time remaining until resolution
2. Identify the most likely outcome if current trends continue
3. Describe a plausible scenario for a "No" outcome
4. Describe a plausible scenario for a "Yes" outcome
5. Provide your reasoning process, considering the base rate and status quo
6. End with your probability estimate formatted exactly as: "Probability: X%" (where X is between 0-100)
